#LXD's Demo
## notice
This Demo is written by lxd by using lxd's Space Game Engine v1.0(it has been deprecated because of its bad design).Because of the short develop time and the old engine code's issues,the code of the demo maybe ugly,however,it's just a little demo,please do not care about that.
## try
* use VS2017 to compile.
* use WASD to move.
